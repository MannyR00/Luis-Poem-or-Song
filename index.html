    <h4>[Verse] 1</h4>
    <p>Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?</p>

    <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
    <p>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving</p>

    <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
    <p>Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year"
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go</p>
