            <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>

            <p>
              Going back to the corner where I first saw you <br>
              Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move <br>
              Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand <br>
              Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?" <br>
              Some try to hand me money, they don't understand <br>
              I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man <br>
              I know it makes no sense, what else can I do? <br>
              And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you? <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
              <br>
              And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
              <br>
              Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
              <br>
              And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
              <br>
              So I'm not moving I'm not moving

            <p>
              Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here" <br>
              I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for <br>
              If it's a day, a month, a year" <br>
              Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows <br>
              If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go <br>

              People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh <br>
              There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm
              <br>
              Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved <br>
              And maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news <br>
              And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just
              for you <br>
              I'm the man who can't be moved <br>
