    <h4>[Verse 1] </h4>

    <p>Going back to the corner where I first saw you <br>
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move <br>
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand <br>
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?" <br> 
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand <br> 
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man <br> 
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do? <br> 
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you? <br> 
</p>

    <h4>[Chorus]</h4>

    <p>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me <br>
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be <br>
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet <br>
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street <br>
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

    <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>

    <p>Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here" <br> 
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for <br> 
If it's a day, a month, a year" <br> 
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows <br>  
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go <br>

    <h4>[Bridge]</h4>
        
    <p>People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh <br> 
There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm <br> 
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved <br> 
And maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news <br> 
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you <br> 
I'm the man who can't be moved <br>  
I'm the man who can't be moved <br>

Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet, oh, oh) <br> 
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street) <br>
